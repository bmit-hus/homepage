Introduction
------------
As a child, I couldn't understand why people couldn't understand things which I understood. As a
teen, I couldn't understand why people needed everything taught the easy way. And today, I ask 
myself why we cannot talk about things without complicating them... But that's a different story.

So, I came to love simplicity. Not because things are simple but because one can only deal with
so much. Therefore, I try to keep things as simple as possible. Although, I think I am really bad
at this lol But I can learn and I have learned over the last few months to make it simpler. Learning
to code had certainly its impact in that. It made me realize that we are not as intelligent as I 
thought and even worse, it made me realize that I think too complicated. Which draws me further
towards programming, for there you have to learn how to communicate properly with your stupid 
machine (which you programmed haha). Following this logic, a programm can only become as 
intelligent as its creator - but knowing that humans are not as intelligent as we like to 
think of ourselves makes me worry a bit... 'Arrogance comes before the fall' or something like 
that..? Anyway, I like coding and trying out different configurations and settings and lines
and whatever one can try to improve something... So, I learn to make something as simple as I can. 
But I try not to make the implementation of something *simple* but that something needs to be as
*simply* implemented as possible to enable you to do your job as *simple* as possible. But that 
most of the times takes time and experience. Which is why I like to take my time and experiment 
around with different ideas to get a grasp on the possibilities and look what the results are. 

I cannot remember where this idea comes from but the idea says:
> 'One has not understood something as long as you can articulate something so easily even a child 
>  can understand it proficiently.'

*proficiently* meaning 'to a degree that the child can use the information to its advantage'. So,
I believe that to be a really good guideline to check if I understood something because it test
many things at once. Your personal mastery over the topic at hand, your mastery of language, even
your social skills. Which is quite the feed in my opinion, at the very least. 
Anyhow, 
I trust in my capabilities of analyzing and understanding processes and my effort is to further 
improve that skill. But with understanding and know what and why something goes wrong, is the 
Problem not solved. Which is why I am such a mess altough being able to articulate in bigger detail
what goes wrong... Well, that's something i can improve on and I have already improved on this 
during the last year. I have put myself into the working force - well, I already made work 
experience but I was different. Now, I adjust myself to become an active member in the work force 
for the work-to-be-done. Sometimes I succeed, sometimes I don't - but that's normal. I learn by the
day and I improve by the day and grow by the day - And that is my goal: *To grow with each day*.

Resources
---------

### Linguistic Resources
My mother tongue is *Swiss German*. I am fluent also in *german* and *english*, and know also some 
*Japanese* and *French*. 

### Technical Resources

**Linux vs Windows** 
I switched to Linux at the beginning of 2020. I haven't done much yet but I like tinkering with the
system and drivers, struggling with dot-files and calibrating the system to how I like it. This is
the biggest advantage which Linux brings - which I miss from Windows. I grew up on Windows, meaning
I know and love the advantages which come with Windows. Yet still, since I work with Linux, I miss 
the costumizability on Windows.

**Web Development**
I know the basic web development languages like *HTML5*, *CSS3*, *JavaScript* and *PHP*. While I'm 
still learning PHP I already built this web page with it and feel pretty confortable using it. I 
also use *CSS Grid* to manage the layout for my website. I could have used bootstrap but I like 
to write the code myself and as far as I could see, Grid is lighter than bootstrap. 

I use *GitHub* (everything is 'private' so far) and learn more and more how to properly use this 
wide spread and powerful development tool. 

The next thing I want to learn is either *Node.js* or *SQL* - depending on what I can use for my 
personal Web Hub. I think it will be *SQL*.

**Programming**
I haven't much experience but have already "tested the waters" with C# for smaller projects, same 
with Kotlin/Java for simple Android Apps and Python.

### Private Resources


Hobbies
-------

### Fencing
I love Fencing. It's fast, precise and elegant - all at the same time. I haven't done some proper 
fencing in quite a while but I will come back to it as fast as I can - I really miss it...

<!-- 
### Thinking
Well, I like thinking about stuff, 
some speak of a tendency to *philosophize*.
I had some lectures in Philosophy at University and
their way of thinking and my way is just too different -
at least, to me - that I want to avoid speaking like its the same.
You know, "same same but different."

If you're interested in my thoughts, you may Bookmark this site and 
wait for my blog site to come online.
Maybe in half a year? I dunno yet.

<!-- 
### Stories
I LOVE stories.
I watch Anime, Series or movies, play Video Games or read Light Novels
to indulce in new worlds and ideas in general.
The other thing I do is 'daydream' stories.
One day, I am a Magical Wolf Beast or the Empire's Princess,
and the next day, I am a Thousand year old Vampire living in the present day,
and the other day, I was an Artificial Intelligence in a custom built mechanical body,
the possibilities are limitless.
And that's where I mostly get my inspiration for my thinking.
