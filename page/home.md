Welcome to my Website
=====================

Hi,

Currently, you are looking at my creators, **Stigie Huber**'s Website. The site is mostly 
handwritten, and still far from complete. But for now, it does its purpose of being a plattform for
growth, in coding skills that is. 

Thus far this site runs on *PHP*. The layout and design is all in *CSS*, or *CSS Grid* to be a bit 
more specific. And that's basically all you really need to know. If you want to know more, I intend 
to implement a page where one can see what I have used and how. 

The content you read, i.e. the text you're reading right now, is written in *MarkDown* and not in 
*HTML*, or to be more precise it is a *MarkDown*-file and not an *HTML*-file. For I use a Markdown 
Parser to translate the .md file into HTML code. Writing in Markdown effortless and more intuitive 
than writing HTML code. I used *ParseDown* ([check it out][1]) which is easy to implement and even 
easier to use.

I'll keep this file updated, so... you may want to come back in some time again, until then...
