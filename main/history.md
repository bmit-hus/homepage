Background
----------

I have long been looking for my place where I am to contribute to the makings of the world.
In search of this path, I have looked my way around several different scholarly routes.
Before Gymnasium, I was thinking about going IT course or to University: I chose University.
For I wanted to help others.

First as Lawyer.
But soon I realised that it wasn't what I would be good at for I dislike conflict and 
law school was not something you could do if you weren't the concientious type.
Then I thought about psychology.
Hence, my choice of taking the psychology and pedagogy classes in Gymnasium.
Again, I realised that psychology was not what I was looking for.
I thought psychology was about understanding people but I had to accept the fact that
a psychologist was not there to understand people but to help them
(so, understanding people was only a mean to the goal of helping them).
Luckily, I had also philosophy classes for philosophy was trying to explain the world in its essence.
First, I was thrilled by its depth and methodology - 
but soon I realized, I was only learning about the great thinkers of the past.
So, I talked to my philosophy teacher and asked him for advice.
He told me that the philosophy classes we had were not different than those we would have at University -
with the exception of depth, of course.
And at this point... Well, I ran out of options.

This meant, with attending University coming closer by the days now, I had to choose.
Luckily - If one may want to say that - in Switzerland, we have to serve mendatory military service.
