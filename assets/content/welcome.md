# Welcome

This is my current website. *Current* because it is still a work in progress.
Now, like almost everything in IT this fact is a given. Still, I feel the need
to stress this for one simple reason: it is almost empty.

I have some concrete ideas on what I want to implement, and many still very 
abstract ideas. The more specified ideas are visible to you on the *top right*
where the **Page Menu** is. The you will be navigated to the different *pages*
from my website. The coresponding **Navigation Menus** will be displayed to you
firstly, when they exist and secondly, when you visit the pages.

This is all for now. I wish you a good day :)
