Everything about this Project
===============================================================================

Alright, this project was restructured and redone several times over. The reasons
for it correlate with my personal coding skills and experience. Meaning, the more
I could do the more I found insufficiencies and mistakes in my workflow or style.
The easiest way to learn (for me) is to redo everything to have repetition of already
done work and to rehearse my thoughts within the same process. This also provides
me with the opportunity to test my thoughts of improvements in an actual scenario.
Remember, I am not yet a certified programmer, or Web Developer. I am still learning
my career choice and as such I want to learn and improve this way to ensure the
florishing of my skills to the best of my ability.


Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main reason why I chose to restart this time is the style guide which I want
to follow this time. I will start my official training in a few months which provides
me with sufficient reasons to restart this project anew. Especially, since I have
been stuck redoing the code several times now, without making any real progress.

The Style Guide was set my workplace and so I will follow it. I have copied the
[Style Guide](https://gist.github.com/ryansechrest/8138375) into this repository.
