WebHub README
=============

Hi, 

My name is Stigie Huber. I'm a coder in training and you are looking at my [WebHub](hus.bm-it.ch).
I got a lot of plans for my WebHub but barely time to work on them... But I try to do as much as I 
can and update accordingly.

I have many reworked this page a lot of times, mainly due to a lack of experience in coding and 
certain technologies. Now, I'm working on Version 3.0 and am pretty stocked for the things to come.

This README contains various information about this page. Feel free to read it and maybe visit 
[my GitHub](https://github.com/bmit-hus).
