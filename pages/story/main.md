Background
===============================================================================

I have long been looking for my place where I am to contribute to the makings of 
the world. In search of this path, I have looked my way around several different 
scholarly routes. Before Gymnasium, I was thinking about going IT course or to 
University: I chose University. For I wanted to help others.

First as Lawyer. But soon I realised that it wasn't what I would be good at for 
I dislike conflict and law school was not something you could do if you weren't 
the concientious type. Then I thought about psychology. Hence, my choice of taking 
the psychology and pedagogy classes in Gymnasium. Again, I realised that psychology 
was not what I was looking for. I thought psychology was about understanding people 
but I had to accept the fact that a psychologist was not there to understand people 
but to help them (so, understanding people was only a mean to the goal of helping 
them). Luckily, I had also philosophy classes for philosophy was trying to explain 
the world in its essence. First, I was thrilled by its depth and methodology - but 
soon I realized, I was only learning about the great thinkers of the past. So, I 
talked to my philosophy teacher and asked him for advice. He told me that the philosophy 
classes we had were not different than those we would have at University - with 
the exception of depth, of course. And at this point... Well, I ran out of options.

This meant, with attending University coming closer by the days now, I had to choose.
Luckily - If one may want to say that - in Switzerland, we have to serve mendatory 
military service.

Introduction
------------
As a child, I couldn't understand why people couldn't understand things which I understood. As a
teen, I couldn't understand why people needed everything taught the easy way. And today, I ask 
myself why we cannot talk about things without complicating them... But that's a different story.

So, I came to love simplicity. Not because things are simple but because one can only deal with
so much. Therefore, I try to keep things as simple as possible. Although, I think I am really bad
at this lol But I can learn and I have learned over the last few months to make it simpler. Learning
to code had certainly its impact in that. It made me realize that we are not as intelligent as I 
thought and even worse, it made me realize that I think too complicated. Which draws me further
towards programming, for there you have to learn how to communicate properly with your stupid 
machine (which you programmed haha). Following this logic, a programm can only become as 
intelligent as its creator - but knowing that humans are not as intelligent as we like to 
think of ourselves makes me worry a bit... 'Arrogance comes before the fall' or something like 
that..? Anyway, I like coding and trying out different configurations and settings and lines
and whatever one can try to improve something... So, I learn to make something as simple as I can. 
But I try not to make the implementation of something *simple* but that something needs to be as
*simply* implemented as possible to enable you to do your job as *simple* as possible. But that 
most of the times takes time and experience. Which is why I like to take my time and experiment 
around with different ideas to get a grasp on the possibilities and look what the results are. 

I cannot remember where this idea comes from but the idea says:
> 'One has not understood something as long as you can articulate something so easily even a child 
>  can understand it proficiently.'

*proficiently* meaning 'to a degree that the child can use the information to its advantage'. So,
I believe that to be a really good guideline to check if I understood something because it test
many things at once. Your personal mastery over the topic at hand, your mastery of language, even
your social skills. Which is quite the feed in my opinion, at the very least. 
Anyhow, 
I trust in my capabilities of analyzing and understanding processes and my effort is to further 
improve that skill. But with understanding and know what and why something goes wrong, is the 
Problem not solved. Which is why I am such a mess altough being able to articulate in bigger detail
what goes wrong... Well, that's something i can improve on and I have already improved on this 
during the last year. I have put myself into the working force - well, I already made work 
experience but I was different. Now, I adjust myself to become an active member in the work force 
for the work-to-be-done. Sometimes I succeed, sometimes I don't - but that's normal. I learn by the
day and I improve by the day and grow by the day - And that is my goal: *To grow with each day*
