Welcome to my Website
===============================================================================
Hi,

Currently, you are looking at my creators, **Stigie Huber**'s Website. The site 
is mostly handwritten, and still far from complete. But for now, it does its purpose
of being a plattform for growth, in coding skills that is. 

Thus far this site runs on *PHP*. The layout and design is all *CSS* with *Grid*. 
It is not yet responsive though, I didn't come to make the media queries yet. First,
I want to learn some SQL for a Login System and maybe some other Features before 
that. If you want to know more, I intend to implement a page where one can see/read 
what I have used and how, like a patchnote site. 

The content you read, i.e. the text you're reading right now, is written in *MarkDown*
and not in *HTML*, or to be more precise it is a *MarkDown*-file and not an *HTML*-file.
I use a Markdown Parser to translate the .md file into browser friendly HTML code.
Writing in Markdown effortless and more intuitive than writing HTML code which is
why I chose to do it that way. I used *ParseDown* for that which is easy to implement
and even easier to use - [check it out here][1].

That's all for now.
