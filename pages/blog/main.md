With these words was the Gravemind in Halo 2 introduced to the player the first 
time within the franchise. To watch the scene follow [this link][1]. I love this 
introduction, and I can - somewhat relate to it. Sure, I'm not as old as this creature 
but I too have listened to much talk, and intend on sharing my talk now to the 
public as well.

Well, I'd like to be saying "Here are some articles" or something like that but 
I haven't come around that thus far. So, you will be able to read some articles 
from me in the future...
