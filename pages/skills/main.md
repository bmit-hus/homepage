**Linux vs Windows.** 
I switched to Linux at the beginning of 2020. I haven't done much yet but I like 
tinkering with the system and drivers, struggling with dot-files and calibrating 
the system to how I like it. This is the biggest advantage which Linux brings - 
which I miss from Windows. I grew up on Windows, meaning I know and love the 
advantages which come with Windows. Yet still, since I work with Linux, I miss 
the costumizability on Windows.

**Web Development.**
I know the basic web development languages like *HTML5*, *CSS3*, *JavaScript* and 
*PHP*. While I'm still learning PHP I already built this web page with it and feel 
pretty confortable using it. I also use *CSS Grid* to manage the layout for my 
website. I could have used bootstrap but I like to write the code myself and as 
far as I could see, Grid is lighter than bootstrap. 

I use *GitHub* (everything is 'private' so far) and learn more and more how to 
properly use this wide spread and powerful development tool. 

The next thing I want to learn is either *Node.js* or *SQL* - depending on what 
I can use for my personal Web Hub. I think it will be *SQL*.

**Programming.**
I haven't much experience but have already "tested the waters" with C# for smaller 
projects, same with Kotlin/Java for simple Android Apps and Python.

**Languages.**
My mother tongue is *Swiss German*. I am fluent also in *german* and *english*, 
and know also some *Japanese* and *French*.

**Fencing.**
I love Fencing. It's fast, precise and elegant - all at the same time. I haven't 
done some proper fencing in quite a while but I will come back to it as fast as 
I can - I really miss it..

**Cooking.**

**Stories.**
I LOVE stories. I watch Anime, Series or movies, play Video Games or read books/Light 
Novels to indulce in new worlds and ideas in general. The other thing I do is 
'daydream' stories. One day, I am a Magical Wolf Beast or the Empire's Princess,
and the next day, I am a Thousand year old Vampire living in the present day, and 
the other day, I was an Artificial Intelligence in a custom built mechanical body,
the possibilities are limitless. And that's where I mostly get my inspiration for 
my thinking.
