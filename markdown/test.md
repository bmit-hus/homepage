What Does It Mean *To Learn*?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You might have asked yourself this question before. And maybe, you even
found an answer, an answer which was sufficient for you to lay down this topic
as "answered," or like I like to call it "well enough answered to not bother me
anymore." Well, I have found an answer to this particular question as well and 
I want to share it with you right here, right now.

I have found my answer by thinking about the number *Zero*. I regretfully cannot
remember who taught me this idea but this someone is [an angel][angel]. Anyhow,
I have loved this idea ever since and I'd like to use this idea to put forth my 
thoughts on *learning*.

We all know the number Zero. We also know that Zero has the value of *nothing*.
Being nothing in value means that you cannot get *anything* for it, right? Wrong.
See, without the number Zero you cannot get to the Number *Ten*, or *One Hundred*
and so on. In other words, our number system depends on something which has 
**no value by itself**.

Now, when you *learn* something you also do nothing which has value by itself
(at least, not in a marketable sense). But without *learning* this lesser *thing*
you will not, or worse cannot get to the next higher level of expertise. Thus,
*to learn* means growing by doing something which has no value (by itself) at 
the moment but which is necessary to grow into something bigger.
